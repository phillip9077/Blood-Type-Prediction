# Blood-Type-Prediction
A simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using Tensorflow and Keras to predict possible offspring blood types by inputting parent blood types.

# Usage
There are two Python files in this repository: training.py and game.py. Training.py contains the ANN architecture as well as a short text output to test the trained model. Game.py contains a small Pygame-based game I developed to make this project more interesting for middle school students.

Both files can be run via whatever terminal interface you use,
```
/ python training.py
/ python main.py
```
or though an IDE if you have one installed.

# Training
If you wanted to retrain the ANN yourself, there are three .csv files available in this repo. **Blood_types.csv** takes into account Rh factor (+ or -) and lists out all possible blood type combinations based on it. **Blood_types_simplified.csv** removes the Rh factor, reducing the dataset to just 16 possible combinations (4 blood types, 4! combinations). Lastly, **Blood_types_mendelian.csv** incorporates true Mendelian genetics into the dataset, but still using the blood types rather than alleles. 

The first two datasets will give you the highest ANN accuracies. The third dataset stays true to Mendelian genetics, but for some reason it does not result in an equally accurate ANN. However, the resulting probability matrix that the ANN trained with the third dataset outputs is close enough to the probabilities expected from drawing out a Punnet Square. Feel free to expand on that dataset even more by introducing alleles, which would definitely make the ANN more accurate.

# Reflection
The accuracy of the saved model in this repo is ~~96.5%, but that is definitely due to overfitting and the lack of samples in my self-curated dataset. There is a possibility that if you try to train the model yourself the accuracy would be nowhere near 96.5%; Again, this is because the lack of samples and can only be corrected through acquiring a larger dataset.~~ 100% after I curated a new dataset. I discovered that, despite the original accuracy of 96.5%, the actual model outputs were incorrect due to discrepancies in the original dataset. Therefore, I made a new dataset, retrained the model, and voil√†: **a 100% accurate model with the expected outputs.**  Additionally, the ANN is most likely not optimized, but there are several paths one could take to improve it:
  1. ~~Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is not the most efficient optimizer for the ANN, so an alternative one such as Adam or RMSprop could potentially reduce training times.~~ I have made the change from SGD to Adam, though how much faster the training occurs I have not measured. 
  2. The hyperparameters can be altered to maximize the ANN efficiency. For anyone who knows more about machine learning and AI in general than me, give this a shot!
  
Lastly, I want to add that this ANN is by no means accurate in terms of how blood type genetics actually works. I
made the decision to simplify the concept by excluding proper genetics (A, B, O, and Rh alleles), but I also added a dataset that follows Mendelian genetics for those who are curious and want to learn more. 

It would definitely be interesting to see a model developed that can accurately predict blood types based on alleles and whether the model predictions would reflect the famous Mendelian ratios as well.
